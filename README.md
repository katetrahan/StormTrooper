# _StormTrooper_

## Planning

  * Review Android Independent Projects Lesson.
  * Read over different categories for project work.
  * Look into API options/research usability.
  * Draw out reasonable flow of info and user experience.

#### _An application using Android Studio. Created and ready to be built on in the future._

#### By _**Kate Trahan**_

## Idea/Explanation

_This application is used to take in the User's Location and share the weather of that location. I plan to add inches of rain to the app and based on how much rain is in the area I would like to add a guide on how much water to give plants as overwatering can be just as dangerous as under watering.. Created 3/16/2018._

### Specs
