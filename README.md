#### By _**Kate Trahan**_

## Idea/Explanation

_This application is used to take in the User's Location and share the weather of that location. Depending on the weather result the application will give ideas on what to do that day or it will give ideas on where to go if the user wishes to escape to a different weather condition. Created 3/16/2018._
